# weatherDashboard

This weather dashboard is designed to display the local weather conditions and five day forecast of any city you enter.
The application uses the Open Weather Map API to provide accurate weather data.
For each city you enter, a button will be created, and if you click on that button that city's weather forecast will re-appear.  

You can find the weather dashboard here: https://richardwalter515.github.io/weatherDashboard/
